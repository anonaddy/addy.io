* If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
* For keeping track of authenticated sessions we use a small number of cookies. This site does not provide any third party cookies and makes no effort to track you. You can delete stored cookies from your browser whenever you wish.
* If you start a subscription we may ask you to provide us with information such as your name and payment information. Your name and card details will not be stored in our database.

All the site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously. Cookies are not used and no personal data is collected. There are no persistent identifiers. No cross-site or cross-device tracking either. You can find out more on [Umami's](https://umami.is/) website.

Our site does not store/save any emails that are forwarded or replied to through the service. You can check the source code to see what happens when an email is piped to our application by Postfix.

Our server uses Postfix as the mail server software and Nginx as the web server. Nginx access and error logs are kept which do record IP addresses. Default log settings are used for Postfix. All log files are rotated daily and retained for 3 days, old log files are deleted.

Server logs are only used to improve our service and prevent abuse or prohibited use. This information will not be provided under any circumstances to any parties other than when compelled by law.

## Protection Of Personal Information

Our website is open-source and available for anyone (who understands PHP) to view and audit. We do not use Google Analytics or any other invasive tracking on our site.

## Security

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers in the Netherlands (UpCloud). Sensitive data in our database such as your recipient email addresses, alias descriptions, public GPG keys are encrypted using OpenSSL and the AES-256-CBC cipher. Furthermore, all encrypted values are signed with a message authentication code (MAC) to detect any modifications to the encrypted string. Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is also available on our site and we encourage users to enable it.

Opportunistic DANE TLS encryption with strong cipher preference is used for all emails sent through our service. Our mail server also utilises STARTTLS, PFS, DNSSEC, MTA-STS, TLS-RPT, DMARC, SPF and DKIM. These measures help to protect emails sent to/from our server against MiTM (Man in The Middle) downgrade attacks and also against the risk of email forgery.

Our site also uses security features such as; HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security), a strict CSP (Content Security Policy), Subresource Integrity, Expect CT and XSS Protection.
